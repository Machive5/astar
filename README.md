it's just an a* algorithm. I Just made the visualizer on website you can see it at machive5.github.io/astar

A* is a path finding algorithm. This algorithm is more efficient than dijkstra algorithm because A* looking the best path using heuristic function (h) it make the algorithm prioritized the best node first unlike dijkstra that just explore all possible ways. You can see how it works with the visualizer.
